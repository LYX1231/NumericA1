Assignment 1 for ENGR30003 - Numerical Programming for Engineers
Process a large amount of data from a flat plate case in a CSV format file. This assignment consists of four processing tasks which will be assessed independently. For each task you are to measure the run time it takes to complete the described task using your program (see program output below). Each of the four tasks must not require more than 60 seconds to run on dimefox using valgrind. This means, in order to complete the task within this time limit, you may need to focus on the eﬃciency of your solution for each problem. Overall you have to write a single program, performing each of the four tasks sequentially. For each task you have to write your results to a ﬁle on the disk. Details on using valgrind is available in the “Implementation” section of this assignment.
